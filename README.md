# SelfScript

Add your own token to the `.env` file, or rename `.env.example` after replacing it with your token. 

Then, add link to bots you want to add to any server you want in `inviteURLS.txt` file or you can also rename the filename to the one you want to use in `main.ts` file!

And see the magic!
